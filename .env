# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:
# - Do NOT put the PayPal client secret in this frontend .env file or commit it to source control.
# - Keep the client secret on your server (server environment variables) as PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET and use it only server-side to verify orders or call PayPal APIs.
# - Example server env names (set these on your backend host):
#     PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID= (same as above)
#     PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_live_client_secret_here

# Restart the dev server after changing this file: npm run dev
